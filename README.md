# team-profile-generator

## Description

**Goal**: To build a command-line application that takes in a team's employee information and generates an HTML file that displays that information.

At larger companies, employees will be split up into teams with each of them fulfilling a different role; sometimes companies will use portals to organize their employees into teams. This application takes information about the employees in a team and creates a page that lists the employees, their roles, ids, contact information, and other information depending on their position.
